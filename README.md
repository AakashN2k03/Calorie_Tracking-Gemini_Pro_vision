# Calorie Tracking by LLM

## Overview
This project aims to predict the calorie content of food items by analyzing images using a Large Language Model (LLM). 
The model is trained to recognize different food items and estimate their respective calorie counts based on the visual features extracted from the images. 
We leverage the power of Google Gemini APi for efficient image processing and inference.
